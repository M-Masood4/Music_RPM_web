### Functions

#### User Panel
This website includes a **signup/login system** where users must enter an **access code** to create an account. These access codes are sold as part of a subscription model and are valid for **30 days**. Once a code expires, users lose access to most of the website features and can only view their dashboard.

The **User Panel** includes:
1. **RPM Information Page** – Provides an overview of RPM (Revenue Per Mille) and details on how the program works.
2. **Music Page** – Allows users to browse, search, filter, and sort music. Here, users can **listen to and download music**.
3. **Link Channel** – Users can submit their YouTube channels for verification by generating a code that must be added to their channel bio. Once completed, users can submit their channel for verification.
4. **Account Page** – Displays account-related information, including RPM, revenue earned, linked channels, and options for password reset.

#### Admin Panel
The **Admin Panel** includes:
1. **Upload Music Page** – Admins can upload music, select an album cover, choose a genre, and add a description.
2. **Approve Channel Page** – Lists all channel submissions. Admins manually verify that users have added the generated code to their channel bio before approving or disapproving channels.
3. **Verified Channels Page** – Displays all verified channels.
4. **Generate Code Page** – Admins can generate access codes for sale or distribution. This page shows which codes have been used, their users, expiration dates, and a list of unused codes.
5. **Update Account Page** – Admins can search, filter, and sort users to update account information, such as RPM, revenue, and optionally upload a YouTube statistics image.

### Story Behind This Project
I collaborated on a side project with a few partners who are highly successful on social media, each with hundreds of thousands of followers. The concept was to create original music and share **50% of YouTube and social media earnings** with content creators who used our music.

When a creator uses licensed music, YouTube allocates **50% of the earnings** to the music owner. For example, with 12 million views, a creator could earn around **$2,000**. By using our music, they could increase their earnings significantly since we shared a portion of our revenue with them. This offered creators an additional revenue stream simply by using our music.

Due to difficulties in obtaining a music license, my partners decided to join our competitors, who already had a fully operational music label and website. Consequently, I stopped further development of the project. All backend work was completed, leaving only the frontend and responsive design.
