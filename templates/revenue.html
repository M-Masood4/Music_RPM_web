    <h1>How We Track and Distribute Revenue from YouTube Shorts</h1>

    <h2>YouTube’s Revenue Sharing Policy</h2>
    <p>
        YouTube Shorts operates under a 45/55 revenue-sharing model. YouTube retains 45% of ad revenue generated 
        from Shorts, while the remaining 55% is distributed among eligible creators, including music rights holders 
        like those using our music app.
    </p>

    <h2>How Our Music App Receives Revenue Information</h2>
    <h3>YouTube’s Content ID System</h3>
    <p>
        YouTube uses a system called Content ID to identify music and other copyrighted material used in Shorts. 
        When a user uploads a Short that contains a track from our music app's library, YouTube automatically 
        flags the video using Content ID.
    </p>

    <h3>Monthly Reports from YouTube</h3>
    <p>
        Every month, YouTube sends us detailed reports about the ad revenue generated from Shorts. These reports 
        contain valuable metrics such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The number of views for Shorts containing licensed music from our library.</li>
        <li>The revenue generated by those views.</li>
        <li>The portion of revenue that belongs to the music rights holders (our music app).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Identify Users and Allocate Revenue</h2>
    <h3>Tracking Channels and Usage</h3>
    <p>
        To ensure that revenue is accurately tracked, our music app monitors which channels are using our music. 
        This is typically done by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyzing the Content ID reports from YouTube.</li>
        <li>Using dashboards provided by YouTube to monitor specific channels and videos using our tracks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Distribution to Users</h3>
    <p>
        If we share a percentage of the revenue with users:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We track specific Shorts that use your music through Content ID.</li>
        <li>Based on the agreement with each creator, we allocate the respective share of revenue to you, 
        determined by the number of views and ad revenue generated by your Short.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Automation and Revenue Tracking</h2>
    <p>
        Our platform uses APIs and automated systems to pull revenue and view data directly from YouTube, 
        update your user dashboard, and automatically calculate and allocate payments based on a predefined 
        revenue-sharing formula.
    </p>

    <h2>Revenue Notification and Payout</h2>
    <p>
        Once your total revenue is calculated and allocated, we will notify you via your dashboard. When your 
        earnings reach a certain threshold (for example, $100), the payout method will be activated, allowing 
        you to receive your share of the earnings directly.
    </p>
